**My research focuses on the application of cutting-edge artificial intelligence methods in plant biology, with the aim of improving human life and sustainability.**

I first began research as an undergraduate at Cornell University, working with Georg Jander at the Boyce Thompson Intitute in Ithaca, NY. While pursuing a bachelor of arts in biochemistry, I worked in the lab and greenhouse on characterizing mutants in the benzoxazinoid pathway in maize, and characterizing pesticide uptake across maize inbred lines for my undergraduate honors thesis. However, after a summer NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates working with Robert VanBuren at Michigan State University, I knew I'd been bitten by the programming bug. I took two computer science classes my senior year and applied to graduate school in plant biology. I've since joined the [Shiu Lab](https://shiulab.github.io/) at Michigan State, where I work on machine learning interpretability in biology and domain-specific knowledge graph reasoning - check out the [projects](serenalotreck.github.io/projects) page for more info. I hope to pursue a career in which I am able to use applications of machine learning to improve sustainability and security in agriculture or biofuel feedstocks.

Alongside my degree in biochemistry, I also pursued Spanish language in my academic and personal spheres. After a stint living in Cornell University's [Language House](https://cornell.campusgroups.com/culh/home/), several undergraduate immersion courses, and a semester studying abroad in Sevilla, Spain, with the [CASA Sevilla program](https://casa.education/sevilla), I am proudly fluent in the Spanish language. I am always looking for opportunities to merge my dual academic interests, and in the past have participated in internship and coursework experiences in conservation biology and plant molecular diagnostics thatcombine scientific learning and teaching with immersive Spanish language experiences, and continue searching out academic and professional opportunities in this vein.

I'm proudly \#BiinSci and passionate about diversity and inclusion in the workplace, participating in MSU's [Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate](https://grad.msu.edu/agep) (AGEP) organization, and part of [Queer In AI](https://sites.google.com/view/queer-in-ai/about?authuser=0). 

In my spare time, I love rock climbing, backpacking, classical ballet, photography, and science fiction. I split my free time between my sports, taking pictures, and looking for new female sci-fi authors to read.
