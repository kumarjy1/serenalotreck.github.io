**My research focuses on the application of cutting-edge artificial intelligence methods in plant biology, with the aim of improving human life and sustainability.**<br>

I first began research as an undergraduate at Cornell University, working with Georg Jander at the Boyce Thompson Institute in Ithaca, NY. While pursuing a bachelor of arts in biochemistry, I worked in the lab and greenhouse on characterizing mutants in the benzoxazinoid pathway in maize, and characterizing pesticide uptake across maize inbred lines for my undergraduate honors thesis. However, after a summer NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates working with Robert VanBuren at Michigan State University on the genomics of facultative Crassulacean acid metabolism in succulents, I knew I’d been bitten by the programming bug. I took two computer science classes my senior year and applied to graduate school in plant biology. I’ve since joined the [Shiu Lab](https://shiulab.github.io/) at Michigan State, where I work on machine learning interpretability in biology and domain-specific knowledge graph reasoning - check out the [projects](https://serenalotreck.github.io/projects/) page for more info. I hope to pursue a career in which I am able to use applications of machine learning to improve sustainability and security in agriculture or biofuel feedstocks, whether that be through genetics and breeding, or a continuation of the plant-science specific information extraction I currently work on.<br>

Alongside my degree in biochemistry, I also pursued Spanish language throughout my undergraduate career. After a year and a half living in Cornell University’s [Language House](https://cornell.campusgroups.com/culh/home/), several undergraduate immersion courses, and a semester studying abroad in Sevilla, Spain, with the [CASA Sevilla program](https://casa.education/sevilla), I am proudly fluent in the Spanish language. I am always looking for opportunities to merge my dual academic interests, and in the past have participated in internship and coursework experiences in conservation biology and plant molecular diagnostics that combine scientific learning and teaching with immersive Spanish language experiences. I continue to search for academic and professional opportunities that will allow me to combine my work with my second language, such as industry internships and positions abroad. <br>

I’m proudly [#BiInSci](https://twitter.com/hashtag/biinsci?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag) and passionate about diversity and inclusion in the workplace. I volunteered at [Out for Undergrad Engineering](https://www.outforundergrad.org/engineering) this year as a mentor to queer engineering undergraduates. At my own institution, I am working with a team of queer graduate students and the [LGBT Resource Center](https://lbgtrc.msu.edu/) to restart QT-GRAD, the organization for queer graduate students.  Beyond LGBTQ+-specific DEI work, I am the chair of the Plant Biology Peer Mentorship Committee. In this position, I have spearheaded the design and implementation of a new peer mentorship program for incoming students in our department. We have designed this program specifically bearing in mind the outsized attrition of underrepresented minority (URM) and queer graduate students from our program compared to their representation in the department, and are currently in our first year of implementation. I personally am a mentor to two students. Thus far, we’ve gotten positive feedback from mentors and students, and look forward to continuing to improve the program! Professionally, I am newly a part of [Queer In AI](https://sites.google.com/view/queer-in-ai/about?authuser=0) and [Women in Machine Learning](https://wimlworkshop.org/) <br>

*Anti-racism statement:* I recognize that I have unwittingly benefitted from systems of racism and oppression in the US, and am working to educate myself and become an effective co-conspirator against anti-Black racism. I have started a bi-monlthy reading/DEI discussion group in my lab in which we discuss how we as a lab can become effectively anti-racist, and am seeking to increase my engagement with anti-racism across all areas of my life.  <br>

In my spare time, I love rock climbing, backpacking, classical ballet, photography, and science fiction. The photos on all the pages on this site are ones I’ve taken! I split my free time between my sports, taking pictures, and looking for new female sci-fi authors to read.
