### Using machine learning interpretability to examine genetic interactions
----------

We are able to observe genetic interactions through quantifiable  loss of fitness in double mutants of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. When the loss in fitness of the double mutant is more or less than the sum of the fitness losses in each single mutant, this constitutes a genetic interaction; something about the way the two genes interact with one another dictates a deviation from pure additive fitness loss in the double mutant. However, we don't necessarily understand the gene interaction network structures that underlie this phenomenon. There are hopelessly many possible explanations for each observable category of gene interactions.

In this project we hope to use machine learning interpretability to investigate mispredicted instances in a model that predicts double mutant fitness. By doing so, we hope to gain a sense of what rules govern the prediction of these rare instances, and to generate a model that can predict yeast double mutant fitness near-perfectly. Subsequently, we hope to incorporate gene network structure in order to investigate the network properties belonging to various classes of genetic interactions.

### Domain-specific knowledge graph reasoning
---------

How many established facts does a scientist miss when doing a traditional literature search? Reading papers one by one is a laborious process that doesn't allow for complex analysis of the entire body of scientific literature published in a given discipline or field. In this project we hope to establish a plant-biology-specific search tool that will generate knowledge graphs for a search term, where nodes are concepts or biological entities, and edges are the connections between them, with links to the references that establish this connection.

Beyond just creating a search tool that will visually aid researchers in finding the information they need, we additionally hope to use the outputs of this search engine to do knowledge graph reasoning. This will allow us to find new connections that an individual might not notice in the graph, leading to a deeper understanding of the existing literature. We also hope to use this tool to find understudied phenomena in a given field.
